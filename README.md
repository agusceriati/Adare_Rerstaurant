# Adare_Rerstaurant

<h2>AdareÂ´s restaurant project</h2>

<p>This was my first "website project" following a YouTube video about coding and web design. It is pretty easy to follow with less than a 100 lines of code. Ideal project for a beginner level. <br> I share this project to the community with the main aim to help other people who are starting in this extraordinary world about programming and web design. <br> I hope it can be helpful and I can contribute something in your development as a future programmer.</p>
