<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>Adare is an authentic traditional Irish pub and restaurant in Brooklyn, NYC committed to providing our guests with a clean, warm and inviting, family friendly atmosphere found in local pubs all throughout Ireland.  We hope you come by to visit, eat, and enjoy our music. <br> Adare was established in Feb 2010 by Austin Walker.  After years of playing at other Irish Pubs and Restaurants in Brooklyn, he decided to open his own Irish Pub and Restaurant dedicated to providing locals and visitors with authentic Irish fare, drinks, music, and great service at an affordable price.</p>
